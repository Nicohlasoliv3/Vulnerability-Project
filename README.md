# Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap: Network Scanning Project

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to delvelope skills and familiarity with utilizing Nmpa. While providing the skills necessary to install and verify Nmpa versions. Also understnad how to utilize Nmap to scan a network to discover active hosts, open ports, and running service & Identify potential vulnerabilities on a network.

### Scenario
You are a Security Analyst who needs to utilize nmap to preform scanning to identify potentail vulnerabilities on a network.
### Skills Learned

- Network Monitoring
- Network Security
- Vulnerability scanning
- Nmap scanning
- Network scanning

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
