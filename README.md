# Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap: Network Scanning Project

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to delvelope skills and familiarity with utilizing Nmpa. While providing the skills necessary to install and verify Nmpa versions. Also understnad how to utilize Nmap to scan a network to discover active hosts, open ports, and running service & Identify potential vulnerabilities on a network.

### Scenario
You are a Security Analyst who needs to utilize nmap to preform scanning to identify potentail vulnerabilities on a network.
### Skills Learned

- Network Monitoring
- Network Security
- Vulnerability scanning
- Nmap scanning
- Network scanning

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps

## Step 1: Verify The Installation And Version Of Nmap
(Use the terminal to verify the installation and version of Nmap istalled on our system)

## Step 2 (Key Takeaways)
- Reference the nmap help feature or man page when needed to recall information to use when scanning
- Nmap man page, is a detailed manual broken into sections that has additional scanning information and examples.
## Step 3: Perform a Basic Nmap Scan
(Perform a scan on a network to discover active host(s), open ports, and running services.)

## Step 3: Run Basic Nmap Scan On Target

## Step 3 (Key Takeaways)
- Nmap should be preformed with care on authorized targets
- Nmap scanning allow you to monitor you network for potential vulnerabilities and can be used for security audits of exposed ports and services on a network or system.

## Step 4: Perform Nmap Scan Using Options
(Run an nmap scan using options to further assess the network)

## Step 4a ( Running Man Nmap for to view options)
